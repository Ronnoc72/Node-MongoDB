# Node-MongoDB
Assignment for software dev creating a website in node using mongodb.
Ideas:
> Calendar/Reminder App
> Journal App
> Typing Speed App

After some thinking, I was planning to program the typing speed app, mostly because I have never done anything like it before. The plan is to make three pages, the login, the home, and the information gained from the user.
The first thing that I worked on was the main typing application and picking the color palette for the whole website. Most of the time I was working on the script to make the website work.
The second task was creating the login page, just the frontend of it. After that I connected the mongodb module to the page and after with a lot of trial and error I was able to figure it out. I hooked the database to the login page and the user could login in after leaving or registering a new account.
The third task was creating the information page. After the user has time to get data for the database, when the information page is loaded, it calculates the averages of the wpm, mistakes, and accuracy of every text snippet that the user has done.
After that, I made some quality of life things, like the user not having spaces in their name and informing the user if they register a name that is already taken. I reformatted the styles to make it look a ton better and did some bug fixing.
